# Tauri-Based Area Calculator

This is a simple aea calculator written in web technologies like HTML, TS and CSS(TailwindCSS) with a simple Rust backend(actually just a short collection of simple Tauri commands), fully powered by Tauri.
I designed this as a simple way to test out key principles in Tauri.

# Installation:
- Install Rust and NodeJS 17
- Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/bikathi/area-calculator.git`)
- Install dependencies using npm (`npm install`)
- Run project (npm run tauri dev)

> Based on the platform you run this project on, you may have to install some dependencies. For example on Linux, you may have to install `GTK-based` dependencies.
